Simple plugin to see current AFK time of an user when right clicking on it with a specified item

require JetsAntiAfkPro and PlaceholderAPI to work
you can edit the code to remove JetsAntiAfkPro dependency and chose the placeholder you want
i might in the future add this placeholder editable in config to let user the choice and use whatever they want
